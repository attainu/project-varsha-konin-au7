<h1>Coding Hunt</h1>

The main aim of building this was to get all the best tutorials at one place so that each learner can visit here, get some good resources of the programming language and learn. Coding Hunt lets learners identify the most suitable course of their choice.


<h1>Installation</h1>

Please run <em>npm install</em> to get required packages

You can also update the packages by <em>npm update</em>

<h1>We have used the following technologies in our project:</h1>

    1. Express: Express is a NodeJS web application framework which provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

    2. JsonWebTokens: It is used to securely transmit information between the parties as an JSON object . In our project, we have used to authorize the user.

    3. Bcrypt: It is used to hash the password. It makes passwords more secure against brute force attacks.

    4. Express-Validator: Express Validator is an Express middleware library that you can incorporate in your apps for server-side data validation.

    5. Nodemailer: We have also used Nodemailer to send OTP so that Email Verification can be done for the user.

    6. MongoDB: This document data model is a powerful way to store and retrieve data that allows developers to move fast. It is also useful to build scalable applications. 

    7. React: It helps to create large applications where data can be changed without reloading the page. It is fast, scalable and simple.

    8. Axios: Axios is a lightweight, promise-based HTTP client. It is the library that helps us to make HTTP requests to external resources. 

<h1>Future scope</h1>
 Planning to add the feature where the learner can identify the most suitable course of their choice by allowing them to filter courses by fee, course type (video/ebook etc.)
